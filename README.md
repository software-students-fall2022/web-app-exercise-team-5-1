- As a buyer, I want to be able to see the details of each listing to gain a better understanding of the good or service being offered.
- As a buyer, I want to be able to ask questions to the seller so that I can ascertain more information about the product.
- As a seller, I want to be able to add listings so that buyers can find my products/services.
- As a seller, I want to be able to edit my listings so that I can inform potential buyers about the latest information of my listing.
- As a seller, I want to be able to delete my listings so that I no longer receive communication about listings that are not available anymore.
